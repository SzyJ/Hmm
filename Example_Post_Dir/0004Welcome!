This website should serve as a basic introduction to what this project aims to acomplish and provide a useful README presented as an example project that uses the server to show these posts!


So, what is it and what does it do?

The basic idea is to emulate an 'endless' stream of content similar to what websites such as Facebook or Twitter do but you host and manage it yourself so you have complete control over what you want hosted and how you want it presented. I hate how centralised the internet has become so I like to host and make my own stuff.
